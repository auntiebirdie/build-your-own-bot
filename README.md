# Build-Your-Own-Bot

A series of tutorials and examples for building your own Discord bot. Also available on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/auntiebirdie/posts) where you can follow for updates on new tutorials.

Currently open for requests of what tutorials you'd like to see, with the goal of making public bots available from the tutorials to add to your own server.
